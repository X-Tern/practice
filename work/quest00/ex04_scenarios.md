**interview: You're asked to explain a caching system design. What happens if you've always relied on AI to design systems?**

    ANSWER: Complete reliance on AI  will hinder the ability to understand code by myself and therefore i will not be able to write or explain a caching system design when asked in an interview without the availability of AI.

**Production Bug: At 2 AM, you must debug code generated by AI months ago - but AI is offline. Can you fix it?**

    ANSWER: If i have been completely relying on AI i will not be able to fix it.

**New Technology: A new library is released, and AI hasn't been trained on it yet. How do you learn it?**

    ANSWER: Every Library has official docs. so i will read the installations, basic usage and look for possible examples,
    also take quickstart guides, tutorials.

    if its an open source code i will check the git repository.


**Reflection: Write one paragraph explaining how using AI fairly today prepares you for real-world challenges like these.**

        Using AI fairly now as a quide helps me to build critical thinking and problem solving habits by using AI to explain concepts and suggest aproaches, this practice helps me to understand the system and reason through problems, and when facing new tech with minimal documentation, i know how to read, experiment, and adapt. AI becomes a learning accelerator.
