**A short summary of what you learned about AI and self-reliance.**

Using AI to Enhance Learning

    I have learned that using AI can significantly amplify my learning process. It makes understanding concepts faster, clarifies difficult topics, and provides guidance when I am stuck. AI serves as a powerful support tool that can accelerate my growth if used correctly.

Developing Self-Reliance

    At the same time, being self-reliant is essential for my long term development. I should always attempt to solve coding problems on my own before seeking help. This ensures I build real problem-solving skills. In the absence of AI, I must still be capable of thinking critically and writing correct code independently.


**Your main insight about using AI ethically as a coder.**

    My main insight is that AI should be used as a learning assistant, not a replacement for thinking. While AI can speed up understanding, clarify complex ideas, and guide me when I am stuck, I must first attempt to solve problems independently first.



**One paragraph describing how you plan to apply these principles in future quests.**

    In future quests, I plan to first study each problem carefully and attempt to solve with my own solution before seeking any assistance. If I encounter difficulties, I will use AI strategically to clarify concepts, review alternative approaches, or identify gaps in my understanding rather than to simply generate complete answers.
