    I will use AI when:

        I have tried solving a problem myself first without the help of AI.

        I need to understand why and how somethings works.

        I want to explore alternative approaches to solving a problem.

    I will NOT use AI when:

        I haven't tried the problem on my own including debugging.

        If i am completing an exam or interveiw.

        If i am still learning fundamental concepts of particular language.

    I know I'm using AI fairly when:

        I can explain my code without AI's help and also debug the code if need be.

        I could solve a similar problem without the help of AI.

        I feel more confident in my own understanding and ability to explain my code.
