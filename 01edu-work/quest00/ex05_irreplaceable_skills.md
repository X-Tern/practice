| Problem Decomposition    | Breaking down problems logically          | 4/5    | Regularly reflect on solved problems to identify how decomposition could be improved |
| Systems Thinking         | Understanding how components interact     | 3/5    | Regularly review how changes in one part of a system affect the whole. |
| Critical Evaluation      | Knowing when code is wrong or inefficient | 4/5    | Compare multiple approaches to the same problem to understand trade-offs. Use debugging tools, test cases |
| Debugging Mindset        | Investigating unexpected behavior         | 4/5    | i will study common bug patterns  and deliberately practice fixing broken code to sharpen investigation skills. |

    Systems Thinking (3/5)

    3 Specific Actions This Week (Without Using AI):

    Design One Complete Mini-System.
    I will design a small simple caching system and draw an architecture diagram showing all components and how they interact (frontend, backend, database, cache).

    Analyze an Existing Real-World System.
    I will study how a real system works like Git works internally then summarize the full flow in my own words.

    Practice Impact Analysis.
    For one project I’m working on, I will intentionally modify one component and document how that change affects other parts of the system to better understand dependencies and interactions.
